# Usage

Every agent run of this project, totalled from the records in `docs/usage/`: one line per run, written by the runner
(`scripts/devos/usage.mjs`). Never edit those records by hand.

- **Tokens** are as each tool reported them. Cache read and cache write are kept apart from input.
- **Cost** is the tool's own figure where it gives one (Claude Code). Otherwise it is the tokens priced by
  `devos/prices.json`, which you fill in: US dollars per million tokens, per model. DEV_OS never looks prices up.
  "—" means no price is set.
- **Not in these totals:** runs that leave nothing in the repository. They are the gate doctor's and the
  supervisor's second opinions, and a change request answered without a plan. Each shows its usage on its own run
  page or comment.
